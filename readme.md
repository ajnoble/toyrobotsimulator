# TOY ROBOT SIMULATOR

Toy Robot Simulator is a react app built with redux, hooks, styled components and is tested using jest and enzyme. The design pattern loosely follows the Domain or Ducks style for file structure.

## What could be improved

1. The app could be optimized for accessability.
2. Further unit testing coud be completed and also optimized for the PlaceUi component. Turns out using Hooks is a little difficult to test at the moment and you cant test them with enzyme at all!
3. Create a few more low level shared components ie: buttons, headings etc
4. Jest snapshots could be used as a baseline test for all components
